                       I grew up in a good family, one that really enjoyed <b>two things</b>, baking and competetion. With that being said we learned a lot of really cool recipies, and through our competition drove the to what is in our eyes, <b>PERFECTION!</b> Now being moved out and on my own I want to spread my joy of baking and the smiles it brings to my community.
